{30406}{30460}That incident is not only classified,
{30463}{30525}but it never happened, you got it?
{30528}{30619}-Yes, sir.|-Once again, we have no alien, no U.F.O.
{30622}{30676}If you can't get me either one,
{30679}{30727}then you'd better start|looking for another job.
{30730}{30793}Well, you heard him! Move it!|It's out there somewhere!
{30796}{30844}-So, move it! Go! Move!|-Yes, sir!
{30847}{30944}And God help the poor soul...
{30947}{31003}who picked him up.
{31236}{31292}[Screams]
{31295}{31341}Silence, subculturer!
{31344}{31444}-Let me down!|-Look what you did to me. Barbarian!

{31570}{31619}[Grunts]
{31663}{31745}For a thief,|you are extremely clumsy.
{31748}{31832}-Thief? I'm not a thief.|-So I see.
{31835}{31904}Tim O'Hara.|You are a reporter.
{31907}{31968}Reporter? No.|I'm a producer, pal!
{31971}{32049}-Let me tell ya, I-- Aaah!|-[Electronic Buzzing]
{32052}{32144}Look, I didn't steal anything, okay?|I don't know what you're talking about.
{32147}{32208}-All right, all right.|-[Electronic Buzzing]
{32211}{32284}No! No!|[Coughing]
{32287}{32360}Warning, Tim O'Hara. Any attempt|to expose me will be useless.
{32459}{32572}-I think we use more than ten.|-Your astronauts|pee in their space suits.
{32575}{32647}Case closed.
{32691}{32741}[Grunting]
{32744}{32801}Okay. Okay, just--
{32804}{32904}[Electronic Whirring]
{32975}{33060}Whoa!
{33199}{33292}Okay, it's just a dream.|It's a very bad dream.
{33295}{33415}[Panting] Just-- Come on.|Wake up. Wake up!
{33418}{33477}What's with that?
{33480}{33580}-I believe it's called|a nervous breakdown.|-Last night did not happen.
{33583}{33659}-I don't believe in aliens.|-I heard that!
{33662}{33748}To us, you are the alien.
{33751}{33816}If you must know,|I am from the planet you call Mars.
{33819}{33916}-And what, I'm from Uranus? I never--|-I was getting to you!
{33919}{33969}Don't get a crease in your Sputnik.
{33972}{34024}[Zoot] Please,|just introduce me to monkey boy.
{34027}{34124}This is my Zoot.
{34127}{34212}-A polymorphous Zootenex 3,000.|-Just look, don't touch.
{34215}{34296}-Your suit talks?|-[Scoffs] Incessantly.
{34299}{34345}Corduroys talk,|nobody gives them grief.
{34348}{34396}-[Zoot] Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.|-Mars? Wait a minute.
{34399}{34491}[Stuttering] There's no life on Mars.|We've sent probes.
{34494}{34579}I'd try to explain it, but you people|still think "E" equals "MC" squared.
{34582}{34680}-You're still trying to|analyze our rocks. Ha-ha!|-[Hydraulic Hissing]
{34683}{34768}Oh! Blasted sand particles.
{34771}{34847}They've completely crystallized|the vortex generator.
{34850}{34908}-Hey, do you mind?|-[Knock On Door]|-[Mrs. Brown] Tim!
{34911}{34952}-[Gasps]|-Now what?
{34955}{35011}-Thank God, an eyewitness.|-Eyewitness? Negative.
{35014}{35112}-You must tell no one.|-No offence, but your ship is|double-parked in my living room.
{35115}{35173}You're the biggest story|in the history of mankind!
{35176}{35240}There is intelligent life|out there in the universe!
{35243}{35284}I hope you're not including yourself|in that statement!
{35287}{35352}Tim, listen, I'm sorry to bother you|so early in the morning,
{35355}{35401}but I got a hold of your mail,|and I wanted--
{35404}{35489}Could you just-- please, come here.|Take a look at that!
{35492}{35561}[Tim]|Aaah!
{35564}{35680}Tim, you definitely need a maid!|Oh, hello!
{35735}{35851}-Greetings.|-Oh, I'm sorry to catch you|in your... pyjamas.
{35854}{35941}-Pyjamas? [Muffled]|-[Stammering] Where's the spaceship?
{35944}{36004}-[Mrs. Brown] Spaceship?|-Right here.
{36007}{36077}Oh, for the rummage sale!|Does it come with an action figure?
{36080}{36149}-You're looking at him.|-[Chuckles]|Oh. I don't believe we've met.
{36152}{36224}-No, don't touch him! He's a Martian.|-Tim, what's going on?
{36227}{36273}-[Stuttering]|-I beg your-- Mart-- Martin?
{36276}{36336}-Yes. Martin.|-No, no, no, no!
{36339}{36396}-He's a-- uh--|-Uncle!
{36399}{36476}-Martin.|-Oh.
{36479}{36552}-Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.|-He turns invisible, okay?
{36555}{36601}His suit talks--|he's got a talking suit.
{36604}{36652}He's got these things that|pop out of his head-- You just--
{36655}{36712}-Show her. Go ahead.|Come on, give her the finger.|-Tim!
{36715}{36820}No, I didn't mean that.|I don't know what I mean. Forget it.
{36823}{36893}You'll have to forgive Tim, Mrs. Brown.|He lost his job last night,
{36896}{36944}and he's experiencing|a nervous breakdown.
{36947}{36997}Oh, poor dear.
{37000}{37048}-I hope it doesn't affect the rent.|-[Laughing Hysterically]
{37051}{37120}-Don't worry,|I'm here to look after him.|-Ha!
{37123}{37215}He's very lucky to have|an uncle like you in his life, Martin.
{37218}{37308}And you, Mrs. Brown,|are like a brilliant quasar|in the black hole of my day.
{37311}{37387}Oh! Call me Lorelei.
{37390}{37457}Lorelei.|The sound of...
{37460}{37556}pure mountain spring water|from the centre of the Earth.
{37559}{37622}Oh, my.|[Chuckles]
{37700}{37793}-[Slurping]|-[Stammering]
{37796}{37865}Oh!|[Chuckles]
{37868}{37953}I obviously misconstrued a custom.|I apologize.
{37956}{38036}I'm from... New York.
{38039}{38107}No, actually, it's--|[Stuttering] It's fine.
{38110}{38196}[Stuttering]|It's perfect. [Sighs]
{38199}{38267}-Oh, brother.|-Oh, Martin?
{38270}{38316}Yes, Lorelei?
{38319}{38460}Um, Mr. Brown... passed away|several years ago.
{38463}{38580}-I thought you might like to know that.|-Hmm.
{38583}{38671}Au revoir.|[Chuckles]
{38674}{38720}Hmm?
{38723}{38781}Just for the record,|a handshake will do for me.
{38784}{38832}[Scoffs]|You think that I actually enjoyed...
{38835}{38884}tasting that female's exoskeleton?
{38887}{38980}[Shudders] I merely used my data on|your primitive species to determine...
{38983}{39039}the optimum way|to avoid suspicion.
{39042}{39127}-Yeah, but what's the optimum|way to get home?|-[Scoffs] Blotz!
{39130}{39235}I don't know, Zoot. Where on this|barbaric swamp of a planet...
{39238}{39315}can we find the makings|of an electron accelerator?
{39318}{39388}-[Zoot]|Maybe your new girlfriend has one.|-Oh, that's very funny.
{39391}{39471}Excuse me. Fellas,|I don't mean to interrupt, but...
{39474}{39596}I-I, you know, I think I might be able|to help you find that electron thing.
{39599}{39639}We're toast.
{39644}{39707}I don't believe this.|You really think you can...
{39710}{39756}repair your ship|with all this junk?
{39759}{39813}Everything has been carefully chosen|for its potential to fashion...
{39816}{39876}a crude vortex electron accelerator.
{39879}{39949}Except for this.|A pooper scooper.
{39952}{40016}I have no idea what it does,|but it's fascinating.
{40019}{40127}Excuse me. Where are your|nuclear implosion couplers?
{40130}{40186}For a garden hose?
{40231}{40300}I'm never going to get off|this infernal planet.
{40303}{40355}[Zoot]|The I.Q. of a pancake.
{40358}{40405}You're right. Humans are truly|the amoebas of the universe!
{40408}{40469}Yeah, this from a guy|who talks to his tin foil suit.
{40472}{40545}-Hey, what was that for?|-It wasn't me, it was Zoot.
{40548}{40645}-[Zoot Laughing]|-Come here a sec.
{40648}{40712}Listen, you've been on Earth,|what, all of ten minutes?
{40715}{40772}-It's not so bad here.|-[Chuckles] That's what Neenurt said.
{40775}{40868}-Who?|-Exactly. One of my planet's|most gifted scientists,
{40871}{40932}and now he's gone without a trace.
{40935}{41024}He arrived on Earth in 1964,|and, I presume, was abducted|by your government.
{41027}{41077}I shudder to think what they did to him|in the name of science.
{41080}{41181}-What are they laughing at?|-[Laughing] Hey, space man!
{41184}{41256}-I've been discovered!|-[Electronic Buzz]|-[Gasps]
{41259}{41319}-[Grunting]|-Sorry about that.
{41322}{41361}-Oh, my--|-What happened?
{41364}{41417}They don't know anything.|They were just making fun of your--
{41420}{41501}Making fun. I'm one of|the best-dressed beings on my planet.
{41504}{41552}[Man]|Yo, Elvis! Nice suit.
{41555}{41656}Well, Dorothy, I hate to tell you this,|but you're not in Kansas any more.
{41659}{41708}[Zoot] That's great.|The minute I turn my back,
{41711}{41768}you're getting into|someone else's pants!
{41771}{41843}[Martin] I need to blend in,|and you stand out like a putt|stick at a blackbell convention.
{41846}{41892}[Zoot] I should have known|by the way you've been gawking...
{41895}{41944}at every T-shirt|and sweat pant we pass.
{41947}{42025}-Don't come apart at the seams!|-Why is Zoot always the last to know?
{42028}{42084}-All right, all right, all right!|-[Zoot Sobbing]
{42087}{42177}-Martian footage, take one.|-Zoot, this is tearing me apart too.
{42180}{42247}[Zoot]|I know I'm not what I used to be.
{42250}{42316}I mean, a stretch mark here,|a line stain there.
{42319}{42373}[Zoot Sobbing]
{42376}{42461}[Screams]
{42464}{42528}-Hey!|-Pervert!
{42531}{42603}It's not safe|for a woman around here!
{42606}{42653}I'm ready to blend in now.
{42764}{42843}-Outstanding.|-Martin, that outfit looks ridic--
{42846}{42909}-Stylin', bro!|-Thanks, bro.
{42912}{42960}[Chuckles]|Real cool.
{42963}{43009}I've got the touch on two planets.
{43012}{43067}I gotta get out more.|How did your Zoot take the--
{43070}{43124}Zoot, he's highly intelligent.|He understands.
{43127}{43208}Aaaah!|You used me, you buttonhole!
{43211}{43308}-Go and have your fling.|Colours fade! You'll see!|-[Knock On Door]
{43311}{43367}-Hello?|-Huh? Oh, incoming.

{44180}{44260}See if I care.|Whoa!
{44263}{44348}If love is a crime, lock me up!
{44351}{44447}I'm guilty.|Look at her.
{44450}{44511}A perfect size six,

{44602}{44704}Darling, don't speak.|Just come to me. [Chuckles]
{44707}{44796}Oh, this is crazy.|I'm a polymorph, and you're a polyester.
{44799}{44869}Yes, you're synthetic,|but I like that in a girl!

{44938}{45016}-Oh, what's this, Velcro? Ohh!|-Zoot!
{45019}{45084}Ah! No, thank you, little girl,|I don't want to buy any cookies!

{45170}{45244}Look who's talking,|Mr. Clothes Horse!
{45247}{45341}Now, in you go, or you'll take|a long walk on a short hanger.

{46668}{46751}[Scoffs] Okay, sure, right.|Here, have one.
{46754}{46807}-Come on, let's go. No, no, come on.|-What are you doing?

{46863}{46907}-Not the finger! Don't do the finger!|-Try some.
{46910}{46965}-Why?|-You don't want to try Martian gum?
{46968}{47067}-No, not particularly.|-Afraid, Earthling?
{47239}{47300}You know what, that is not bad.
{47303}{47420}-The centre's got|a nice little zing to it.|-Notice anything different?
{47423}{47488}Hmm, no.|No, not really.
{47491}{47567}What time do you have?
{47570}{47616}Aaaah!

{47971}{48061}-Zipper trouble.|-Yeeow.
{48064}{48125}[Breathing Heavily]
{48128}{48204}This "gum", as you call,|allows me to take on the outward|appearance of a human being.
{48207}{48255}On you, it has the reverse effect.
{48258}{48329}Oh, so that's what you|really look like.
{48332}{48404}Don't be disgusting.|That was Fluvian Nurplex.
{48407}{48476}-Oh.|-We carry many different planets.
{48479}{48600}If you think that was bad,|this is Veenox Seven.
{48603}{48699}-Oh, well, that's--|-Don't ever mess with a Veenox Seven.

{49168}{49239}Usually, the beach conjures up|images of our youth,

{49731}{49796}-Are we still rolling?|-Nobody said "cut."
{49799}{49865}-Feeling hot, hot, hot|-What do you think?
{49868}{49916}I think your bathing suit|should have a top.

{50536}{50601}We're wasting valuable time.|My ship must--
{50604}{50691}Look at that!
{50694}{50744}Do you have any idea|how fortunate you are?
{50747}{50821}The only water we get back on Mars|has to be squeezed from rocks.
{50824}{50903}-Well, surf's up, dude.|-Tim, I'm so glad you came.
{50906}{50968}-Hurricane Brace hit again.|-Oh, okay. Uh, Martin?
{50973}{51024}-I gotta go. I'll be right--|-Lizzie!
{51027}{51084}How nice to see you again.
{51087}{51157}-Have we met?|-Of course!
{51160}{51236}Not. How nice to see you again|for the first time.
{51239}{51301}I'm Tim's Uncle Martin.

{51467}{51526}-I, uh--|-[Rumbling Continues]

{51771}{51848}Oh, he is-- [Chuckles]|He is such a kidder.
{51851}{51904}Listen, I'll be with you|in couple minutes, okay?
{51907}{51968}You just-- I'll be right over.|Tell her to--
{51971}{52036}We gotta get you-- ah!
{52039}{52085}[Stomach Rumbling]
{52143}{52193}Excuse me, could I have|a double dip--
{52196}{52253}actually, make that a triple dip,|chocolate chip, please.
{52256}{52345}-Yes, sir.|-Tim, I need nourishment,|not coloured buckets of frozen lard.
{52348}{52424}Look, this is very|nutritious food here on Earth.|We eat this for breakfast.
{52427}{52511}Tim, you don't need to try poison|to know that it kills.
{52514}{52587}Here, take this.
{52590}{52652}Give me five minutes, okay?|I have to go to the news van.
{52655}{52727}[Groans]|Blecch!

{53304}{53365}Are you--
{53368}{53460}Look, I'm glad you beeped me. We really|need to talk. This is really big.
{53463}{53521}-I know.|-You do?
{53524}{53580}Yes. Look, I've been thinking, and...
{53583}{53675}our friendship really means a lot to me,|and I don't want to screw that up.
{53678}{53732}-Okay.|-So I think it would be better...
{53735}{53832}if we just pretended that nothing|ever happened between us last night.
{53835}{53903}-What happened last night?|-Exactly!
{53906}{53960}I'm not sure I understand what--
{53963}{54011}Me either.

{60660}{60724}All right, Miss Channing.
{60751}{60816}Do you know what this is?
{60819}{60865}This has been|positively identified...

{62444}{62528}May I call you... Doctor?

{62711}{62820}You will be on the cover|of Scientific... whatever.
{62823}{62948}You will be the man|that proves that aliens exist.
{62951}{63075}And I will be the woman|who tells the world your story.

{80031}{80100}Even a substandard species|such as yours has feelings.
{80103}{80200}Just slow down for one millisecond|and look into your heart.
{80203}{80260}Whose face do you see?
{80427}{80493}Look, Brace, I think--|Lizzie!
{80523}{80596}Whoa!|Lizzie, no, wait, wait--
{80599}{80675}-No, please!|-This better be good.
{80680}{80719}Oh, it is. It is.
{80722}{80789}Uh, remember that guy|I was with at the pier yesterday?
{80792}{80866}-Your Uncle Martin.|-He's not my uncle.
{80869}{80917}He's a Martian!
{80920}{80963}-[Chuckles]|-Yeah.
{80966}{81053}-You are such a jerk!|-No, no, no. He's a Martian!
{81056}{81129}It's the truth. In fact,|he's the one who kissed you, not me.
{81132}{81174}-Really?|-Yeah.
{81177}{81235}His head's in my sink right now.
{81238}{81306}-[Grunts]|-Get some sleep. You look awful.
{81309}{81385}-Lizzie--|-And if there was anything kinky|on that videotape,
{81388}{81470}you better get Brace to give it back.
{81573}{81669}[Zoot Grunts] Fine!|Since when did I become a mechanic?
{81672}{81757}-[Drill Whirring]|-Do I look like overalls?
{81838}{81886}Uncle Martin!
{81889}{81955}-[Scissors Snipping]|-[Zoot] Okay. Don't cut the red one.
{81958}{82019}-Or was it the blue one? [Mumbling]|-Ooh!
{82022}{82095}I can't see a thing down here!
{82098}{82146}Oh, thanks.
{82221}{82274}-[Electricity Zapping]|-Ow! Geez, that hurt!
{82277}{82327}-[Screams]|-No!|-[Screams]
{82330}{82390}Lady, please!|Put a sock in it! Quiet!
{82393}{82439}The baby's sleeping!
{82442}{82498}Martin, I told you.|We gotta get to the...
{82501}{82549}TV station before Brace does.
{82552}{82605}-[Martin] Open the bag!|-Okay, okay.
{82608}{82662}-[Gasping] I can't breathe!|-I'm sorry.
{82665}{82731}-Where is that confounded Zoot?|-Zoot? Uh--
{82734}{82822}Zoot! Zoot! I think he's|in the middle of a spin cycle.
{82825}{82915}Leave him! Quick, Tim!|Get my arm out of the other bag!
{82918}{82978}-All right. Okay, okay, okay.|-Okay.
{82981}{83062}-Okay.|-Yes! Excellent! Toward the ship!
{83065}{83109}-Huh? What?|-Higher! Higher! Okay, here!
{83112}{83179}Here we go!|[Grunts] Yes!
{83182}{83243}-[Whimpering]|-[Martin] Easy. Oh, no!
{83246}{83333}-[Screaming]|-Oh, no! Don't send me|to the shrink!
{83336}{83378}-[Whimpering]|-Ohh!
{83381}{83449}-What was that?|-Uh-oh.
{83500}{83547}Sweetie-pie,
{83550}{83598}this is the most amazing footage|I've ever seen.

{83660}{83710}-Van Gundy, call the network.|-Yeah?
{83713}{83778}Brace is going out live|with the story of the century!
{83844}{83891}[Martin]|I'm feeling a little carsick!
{83894}{83942}-Oh!|-Sorry.
{83945}{84006}[Martin Grunting]
{84009}{84094}I can't take it any more.|I can't take it any more!
{84097}{84193}-We're running out of time.|Try and pull yourself together.|-Why? We're all doomed anyway.
{84196}{84279}Without my blasted electron accelerator,|the I.S.S. will blow!
{84282}{84334}I feel like a hacksaw murderer.
{84337}{84395}What the heck is|an electron accelerator anyway?
{84398}{84470}It's a simple low-amperage power source|that activates the main thrusters.
{84473}{84563}-Oh. Kind of like an alternator?|-What's an alternator?
{84566}{84638}-It, uh, turns over the engine in a car.|-[Gasps] A car?
{84641}{84703}That's it! That should work!|We're saved!
{84706}{84754}-Not quite.|-Yes, we are.
{84757}{84820}-Whoo-hoo! Ha, ha, ha.|-Listen, I've been--
{84823}{84890}I've been videotaping you.|I've got everything. I got the ship.
{84893}{84968}I got Zoot.|I even got you in your Martian form.
{84971}{85035}I was putting together a story,|and I was gonna get it on the air,
{85038}{85087}-but I couldn't do it.|-Why not?
{85090}{85130}Because I like you, Martin.
{85133}{85183}I like you. I--
{85186}{85232}And I'm sorry.|I-I just-- I'm sorry.
{85235}{85316}I I-- I apologize.|I shouldn't have lied to you.
{85319}{85386}-You're a good human, Tim O'Hara.|-Oh, oh, yeah. I'm a terrific--
{85389}{85438}Martin!|You're back!
{85441}{85492}And I like you too.
{85495}{85558}-Oh-ho!|-I've never had feelings before!
{85561}{85606}-Oh.|-[Chuckles]
{85609}{85680}Now, let's go fix my ship.
{85683}{85732}Yeah, okay-- No!|No, we got a problem-- the tapes.
{85735}{85818}-Brace goes on with the|Martian story in five minutes.|-Oh, blotz.
{85821}{85910}Yeah, and I got to get these tapes and|get to Brace before she gets on the air.
{85913}{85974}But there's not enough time.|You can't be in two places at once.
{85977}{86058}Yeah. Wait a minute!|Come on!
{86061}{86119}Is there an alien amongst us?

{86277}{86362}Billy, now what?
{86365}{86428}I want to be Brace Channing.
{86431}{86488}Yeah, well, get in line.|I'm sorry.
{86491}{86527}I really don't have time|to do any auto--
{86569}{86644}-[Gasps]|-Quaint, aren't they?
{86647}{86710}These days, most of our young|are born cable-ready.
{86713}{86758}You're the--|[Gasps]

{87095}{87170}Oh, yeah. I was up all night with Brace|working on the alien story.
{87173}{87255}I made a couple of mistakes|in tape number two,|but that's the corrected version.
{87258}{87370}Now if I could just get through this|without having to look in a mirror.
{87373}{87456}-Hmm.|-[Director]|Coming up on three minutes to air.
{87527}{87575}[Grunts]
{87734}{87783}Tim!

{90809}{90864}[Voice Tonality Wavering] What you're|about to see is that evidence...
{90867}{90930}[Squawks]|of the actual footage of the alien.
{90933}{90994}But I warn you--|it's appearance is unlike...
{90997}{91058}[Gasps] anything you are|likely to have seen before.
{91061}{91136}She's going under the table.|She's going under the table!
{91139}{91206}-[Continues, Voice Wavering]|-And go.
